    <description>Stabilized mechanites is a small mod adding 2 drugs which are only obtainable via traders or quest rewards, giving you a lesser permanent bonus like the luciferium based on the well known diseases fibrous & sensory mechanites.
This is a feature that was intended to be part of a larger project, but that i decided to make as a standalone/light version.
