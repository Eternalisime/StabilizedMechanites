    Stabilized mechanites adds 2 drugs which are only obtainable via traders or quest rewards, giving you a lesser permanent bonus based on the well known diseases fibrous & sensory mechanites.\nThis is a feature that was intended for a bigger picture, but that i decided to make as a standalone/light version.\n\nArt and concept by Sir Van, code by Ythern.
